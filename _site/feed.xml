I completed my master&apos;s in Computer Vision at University College London (UCL) advised by [Prof. Niloy Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/).  Previously, I was a Founding Engineer at NFTPort leading machine learning from its inception through its Series A round of $26M. Prior to that, I was a visiting student at the University of California, Berkeley where I worked with Dr Brandie Nonnecke on ML x social network analysis. I have also spent time as a research intern at Nvidia and IIT Kharagpur. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I am interested in generating and editing 3D content (particularly meshes that are compatible with graphics engines) using text instructions, images or other simple modalities.  I believe solving this requires a fundamental understanding of shape design- *what makes a sofa well-designed and functional?* </subtitle></feed>
