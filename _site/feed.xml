I completed my master&apos;s in Computer Vision at &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(235, 40, 124);&quot;&gt;University College London (UCL)&lt;/span&gt; advised by [Prof. Niloy Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/).  Previously, I was a Founding Engineer at  &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(235, 40, 124);&quot;&gt;NFTPort&lt;/span&gt; leading machine learning from its inception through its Series A round of $26M. Prior to that, I was a visiting student at the &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(235, 40, 124);&quot;&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/span&gt; where I worked with Dr Brandie Nonnecke on ML x social network analysis. I have also spent time as a research intern at &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(235, 40, 124);&quot;&gt;Nvidia&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(235, 40, 124);&quot;&gt;IIT Kharagpur&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I am interested in generating and editing 3D content (particularly meshes that are compatible with graphics engines) using text instructions, images or other simple modalities.  I believe solving this requires a fundamental understanding of shape design- *what makes a sofa well-designed and functional?* </subtitle></feed>
