# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a Research Engineer at [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/) working on Generative AI x 3D.
  I completed my master's in Computer Vision at <span style="color: rgb(235, 40, 124);">University College London (UCL)</span> advised by [Prof. Niloy Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/). 
  Previously, I was a Founding Engineer at  <span style="color: rgb(235, 40, 124);">NFTPort</span> leading machine learning from its inception through its Series A round of $26M. Prior to that, I was a visiting student at the <span style="color: rgb(235, 40, 124);">University of California, Berkeley</span>
  where I worked with Dr Brandie Nonnecke on ML x social network analysis. I have also spent time as a research intern at <span style="color: rgb(235, 40, 124);">Nvidia</span> and <span style="color: rgb(235, 40, 124);">IIT Kharagpur</span>.

  I am interested in generating and editing 3D content (particularly meshes that are compatible with graphics engines) using text instructions, images or other simple modalities.  I believe solving this requires a fundamental understanding of shape design- *what makes a sofa well-designed and functional?*
