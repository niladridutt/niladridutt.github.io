I am a first year [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD student at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), sponsored by [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof Niloy Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/) (UCL) and [Duygu Ceylan](https://www.duygu-ceylan.com/) (Adobe). My current research focuses on multimodal learning, combining MLLMs with computer graphics and vision for reasoning in generative and procedural modeling tasks.

I'm currently a Research Scientist Intern at Adobe working with [Xuelin Chen](https://xuelin-chen.github.io/), [Paul Gurrero](https://paulguerrero.net/), and [Chun-Hao Huang](https://research.adobe.com/person/paulchhuang/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
